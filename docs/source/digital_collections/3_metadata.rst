Metadata
--------

Since 2015, UT Libraries has been focused on replacing our MODS XML with RDF-based metadata.  In 2020, we finalized our
`UT MODS to RDF document <https://utk-mods-to-rdf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ that describes how we envision our MODS
as RDF.

It is also our intention that metadata in our next system will not be tied to Models described as code but rather informed
by an M3 profile based on the draft specification set forth in `Houndstooth <https://github.com/samvera-labs/houndstooth>`_
and work by the `M3 Working Group <https://wiki.lyrasis.org/display/samvera/Machine-readable+Metadata+Modeling+Specification+%28M3%29+Working+Group>`_.
